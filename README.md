# Uikit Joomla Notifications
Handy function for a joomla template that will display Joomla alerts as UIkit Notications

Joomla's system messages are quite ugly. Have a look: https://docs.joomla.org/Display_error_messages_and_notices

Wouldn't it be nice to have them show as lovely UIKit Notifications? Yes me too...

So I developed a little function that will do it! 

All you need to do is replace this code in your Joomla Template...


```
<jdoc:include type="message" />
```

...with the code that's in my index.php file. Simples!
